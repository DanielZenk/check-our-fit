## Fashionable Typescript

You're walking through an H&M. Check out those leopard print jeans. Those have got to be stylish right? So you go to the dressing room and throw them on. Funky. Do I like them? I don't know. I need some professional advice on this. Well maybe professional jeans advice doesn't exist. Community advice does exist though!

The purpose of this project is to help you in these situations. You can submit an outfit that you are wearing, and ask questions you want the community to answer. In the meantime, we'll call this Fashionable Typescript. Cause it's all about fashion, implemented with React and Typescript.
