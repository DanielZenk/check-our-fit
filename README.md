## CheckOurFit

Current Status: No longer in use. This was a fun project to learn some GCP and really test my ability to create a full stack application. However, nothing truly tests that like the real-world experience I've had. 

Welcome to the code that drives Check Our Fit. This mobile web app was designed to allow users to create posts of their outfits "fits". A post contains pictures along with questions and answers that the poster creates. From there, the rest of the community can answer the questions on the post, and the poster can see the responses!

You can see the fully functional web application at https://check-our-fit.web.app/. Please use the web app on a mobile device :-)
